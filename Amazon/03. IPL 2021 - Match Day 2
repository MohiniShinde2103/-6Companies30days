/* Problem Statement 
Due to the rise of covid-19 cases in India, this year BCCI decided to organize knock-out matches in IPL rather than a league.
Today is matchday 2 and it is between the most loved team Chennai Super Kings and the most underrated team - Punjab Kings. 
Stephen Fleming, the head coach of CSK, analyzing the batting stats of Punjab.
He has stats of runs scored by all N players in the previous season and he wants to find 
the maximum score for each and every contiguous sub-list of size K to strategize for the game.
